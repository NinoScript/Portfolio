# D3.js + Opentip bar graph test

Old test extracted from an even older project (more than 2 years), previous to the introduction of "```Leading . now closes all open calls, allowing for simpler chaining syntax.```" in CoffeeScript 1.7

## **Thoughts**:
* CoffeeScript didn't play well with chaining JavaScript libraries before version 1.7 (January 2014)
* IcedCoffeeScript is nice when callbacks go too deep (continuation-passing style)
* I tried OpenTip, Tooltip and Tooltipster. At the moment, OpenTip seemed the better choice, I don't remember why.
* Jade is a nice replacement for HTML, even when used statically.
* For some reason, I added JQuery just for the short version of the document ready event. I was probably using it in something else at the same time.
